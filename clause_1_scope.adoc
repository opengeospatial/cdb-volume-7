== Scope


The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single, versionable, simulation-rich, virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store provides for a synthetic environment repository that is plug-and-play interoperable between data store authoring workstations. Moreover, a CDB structured data store can be used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks. In this case, a CDB data store is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators. A CDB data store can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing process that is performed on-demand in real-time.
